# Lesson 1: Welcome to the World of 3D! Build Your First 3D Toy Block

## Objective
In this lesson, students will learn how to create a 3D scene and make some lego blocks in Blender 3D!

## Materials Needed
- Blender Software

### Introduction

Welcome to the Blender 3D course! My name is Mark and I will be your teacher for the class. In this class we're going to learn about Blender 3D, a cool 3D modelling tool that lets us make fun characters, cool animations and interesting games! Over the course, we're going to make some 3D Characters, animated films and cool computer graphics. This is a creative class, so as we are following along with the instructions for the session, please feel free to experiment with different ideas that you think would be cool. Anyway let's begin by getting everything installed.

### Installing Blender 3D

To begin, we need to download Blender to our computer. We can go to the Blender website (https://www.blender.org/download/) and click the download button to get the tool. Next, we click on the file it downloaded and follow the instructions on the screen to get setup with the software. Once complete, you should open the Blender 3D application which looks similar to the following!

### Description of the UI

The Blender 3D tool can look very complicated at first, there's lots of tools, buttons and switches so where do we begin. Well, we will only focus on what we need at any time. So, let's focus on the big area in the middle of the screen that has the cube in it. This is called our "viewport" or simply just the area we'll put our characters, items and so on. 

In this area, we can move, rotate and change the size of our objects to make interesting scenes. On the right side of the screen at the top we have the "hierarchy". We can simply think of this as a list of objects that are currently in our viewport. Finally, below this we have lots of tools that can change our objects in many cool ways, but we'll come back to this later in the course.

### Making our First Object in Blender 3D

Now that we have a rough idea of what this tool looks like, lets try make our first item. To do this, we can simply click on our viewport and press the buttons <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>, which should then show us a list of objects we can add to the scene. For now, lets hover over the 'Mesh' item (which just means a 3D object) and you can add whatever object you like by clicking it. This should then appear in your viewport. If you click on these objects, you should see three arrows. You can click and drag these to move each object around.

- **Task**: Please try add a cube, a cylinder and a cone into your scene!

### Transforming Objects: Rotation, Scale, and Position

Once you’ve added objects to your scene, you can change how they look and where they are by adjusting their **transform** settings. The three main transforms are **rotation**, **scale**, and **position** (also known as **location**).

- **Position**: You’ve probably noticed the three arrows when you click on an object. These arrows allow you to move the object up, down, left, right, forward, or backward in your scene. Just click and drag the arrows to place the object where you want it.
<br/>
- **Rotation**: If you want to turn or spin an object, you can rotate it. To rotate an object, press <kbd>R</kbd> on your keyboard. This will allow you to rotate the object around. You can rotate in different directions by pressing <kbd>X</kbd>, <kbd>Y</kbd>, or <kbd>Z</kbd> to rotate along that axis.
<br/>
- **Scale**: Scaling changes the size of an object. To make an object bigger or smaller, press <kbd>S</kbd> on your keyboard and move your mouse to resize it. If you only want to scale in one direction, press <kbd>X</kbd>, <kbd>Y</kbd>, or <kbd>Z</kbd> after pressing <kbd>S</kbd>.

- **Task**: Try moving, rotating, and scaling your cube, cylinder, and cone! Experiment with different sizes and angles.

### Making our 3D Lego Object in Blender 

Now that we have an idea of how to objects in Blender 3D, lets try to make our own. In this class, were going to try make a Lego Brick using the Meshs that Blender provides. In this example, we can use the cylinders and cube we seen before, but we need to resize them accordingly. We can do this on the right side of the screen with our tools. We will have three items we can change, the position of the object, its rotation and its scale. The XYZ just represents what direction we want to adjust the setting in.

- **Task**: Using one cube and 8 cylinders, create the following item in Blender 3D.

### Making a 3D Snowman in Blender

Now that we know how to add and move objects in Blender, let’s build something fun—a snowman! To do this, we’ll use spheres to create the snowballs for the body and head. We’ll also add smaller objects for details like the eyes, nose, and buttons. We can adjust the **position**, **rotation**, and **scale** to get everything looking just right.

- **Body**: Start by adding three spheres for the snowman’s body. You can add a sphere by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and selecting **Mesh > UV Sphere**. The largest sphere will be the bottom, a medium-sized one for the middle, and a small one for the head. Use the **scale** tool (<kbd>S</kbd>) to resize them.
<br/>
- **Details**: For the eyes, add two small spheres. You can place them on the head using the **position** arrows. For the nose, add a cone to create a carrot shape. Finally, add some small spheres or cylinders for the snowman’s buttons.
<br/>
- **Positioning**: Use the arrows to move each part of the snowman into place. Remember to stack the spheres on top of each other and place the eyes, nose, and buttons in the correct spots.
<br/>
- **Task**: Build a snowman using three spheres for the body, two small spheres for the eyes, and other simple shapes for the nose and buttons. Have fun customizing it with extra details!
